## VAE for anomaly detection with hyperspace optimisation
Update 22/12/2021: Added support for PyTorch Lightning 1.5.6 version and cleaned up the code.

A collection of Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) implemented in pytorch and Tensorflow with focus on hyperspace optimisation. The aim of this project is to provide a quick and simple working example for many of the cool VAE models out there. All the models are required to be trained on the user dataset

Requirements
Python >= 3.5
PyTorch >= 1.3
Pytorch Lightning >= 0.6.0 (GitHub Repo)
CUDA enabled computing device
